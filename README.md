# Cypherock_Extension
This is a google chrome extension that I built in my internship at cypherock. Cypherock was a startup whose head office was at the incubator at DTU. Its first product is a patent-pending hardware-based decentralized recovery management solution for investors in digital assets. Along with the recovery system, it is developing hardware based Blockchain wallet which will support all digital assets and will be integrated with both centralized & decentralized exchanges to provide users with an all-in-one solution for dealing with their digital assets. The company also has three patents pending in the space.
